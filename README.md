# Microprocessor Lab Final Project
In this project, we were asked to fulfill four criteria:
- LEDs blink at different rates: 1s, 500ms and 200ms, respectively.
- The LCD shows time in the first row. In addition, three buttons are considered to increase hour, minute and reset the timer.
- The display shows the temperature in both celsius and fahrenheit in the second row.
- The two DC motors are controlled using PWM. The duty cycle is determined by the potentiometer and displayed on the third row. Finally, the direction of rotation for each of the motors is shown in the last row of the display.

The program has been written for ATMega64 microcontroller using CodeVisionAVR in C language. 
The simulation file is included and can be run using Proteus.
