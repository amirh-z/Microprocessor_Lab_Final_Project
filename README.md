# Microprocessor Lab Final Project
In this project, we were asked to fulfill four criteria:
- LEDs blink at different rates: 1s, 500ms and 200ms, respectively.
- The LCD shows time in its first row.
- The LCD shows the temperature in both celsius and fahrenheit in its second row.
- The two DC motors are controlled using PWM. The duty cycle is displayed in the third row and in the last row, the directions of each of these motors are shown.
